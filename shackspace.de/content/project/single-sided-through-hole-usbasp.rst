|image0|\ shack member Michael built his `own version <http://www.mupfelofen.de/?post/2011/02/14/USBasp>`__ of the famous `USBasp <http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/>`__ by Thomas Fischl.

But it's not just yet another USBasp implementation. This little gem is
a true single-sided PCB without any bridges, all through-hole components
and still maintains a very compact footprint of merely 55mm x 75mm.

This is a very easy to build
`AVR <http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/>`__-programmer suitable even
for beginners.

Simply grab the `source for the
project <http://www.mupfelofen.de/public/projects/usbasp-1.0.tgz>`__ and
start making your own!
