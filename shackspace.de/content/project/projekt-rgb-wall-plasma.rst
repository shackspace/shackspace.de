`4rm4 <https://twitter.com/4rm4>`__ is at it again! A while ago he built
a nice `RGB wall display driven by a
RaspberryPi <http://shackspace.de/?p=3826>`__ which brought great joy to
the space because you could use it to play the classic game of snake
using a Wii nun-chuck connected to it.

This time it's less interactive but adds a serious amount of eyecandy to
the shackspace lounge. He incorporated code from
`dop3j0e <https://twitter.com/dop3j0e>`__'s `16x16 LED plasma
display <http://shackspace.de/?p=1815>`__, tweaked the parameters a bit
and added mapping to the full color range of the larger display.

This is `open source <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>`__ by
example: share what you've learned and made and maybe 3 years down the
road someone will re-use it and add (rainbows) to it.
