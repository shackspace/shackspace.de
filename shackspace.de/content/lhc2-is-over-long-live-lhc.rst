We've had a blast!  It was great seeing so many fellow hackerspace folks
at the space.  We've even had a visitor that told us he heard about us
from `MAKE
zine <http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/08/hackerspace-happenings-pittsburgh-mmf-call-for-makers.html>`__. 
Not sure how we ended up there.  Awesome!

We would like to thank everyone who visited, contributed, hacked,
talked, presented stuff, offered workshops, brought awesome gear and
experimental drinks (Club-Mate wine was awesome! Go RaumZeitLabor!). 
The event was as awesome because all of you made it that way!

If you hacked anything, took photos, or have an anecdote or two, please
let us know (send a mail to hadez a-t shackspace.de) and we'll assemble
everything into a follow-up post here on the blog.

We've had a lot of people at the space and quite some hackerspaces were

two): `c-base <https://www.c-base.org/>`__,
