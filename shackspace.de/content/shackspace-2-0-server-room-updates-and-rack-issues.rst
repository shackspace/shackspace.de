| |image0|\ The "server room taskforce", as the team calls themselves,
spent the whole of Wednesday and parts of Thursday at 0xff (the new
shackspace location) where they brought in two 42RU and one 21RU racks,
patch panels, switches, etc.
|  Result after ~15 hours of work is that the smaller rack is in
position and already equipped with two patch panels for the LAN-Network,
which would work theoretically.  Also the 42RU IBM racks are in
position, which wasn't as easy as it sounds since those things weigh
easily over 100kg and are about two meters high.
|  We found out how to disassemble the racks so they'd fit into the
elevator, transported them to the 1st floor and reassembled them in the
server room.  But when we wanted to place the first server in the rack
we noticed the whole rack had a width of 19" plus an extra ~10cm.  Now
we need to find a way to "shrink" this IBM Blade Center rack to a 19"
standard rack. If you have any hints for us don't hesitate to drop us a
comment below this post.
