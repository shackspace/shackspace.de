There's always a lot of things happening at shackspace and it's often
difficult (even for us who are there all the time) to really notice
everything that's going on. So we want you to take a very brief glimpse
into what happened last weekend. Note: this is by far not covering
everything, since I'm reciting from memory ;)

For starters, we've had Micha who was hacking around some TFT-panels and
touch panels that he's planning to install all over his flat.

@\ `SaijSaij <https://twitter.com/SaijSaij>`__ was working hard
implementing our new website (available soon in an Internet near you).

@\ `tensau <https://twitter.com/tensau>`__ was putting finishing touches
to the stock-keeping software he's written for our [STRIKEOUT:Club-Mate]
beverage storage.

For the second time we've had a `cleaning rage
event <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:cleaningrage>`__.
We're basically telling everyone to meet up on a weekend day for
cleaning. The tasks are handed out randomly, so everyone gets a chance
to [STRIKEOUT:clean the restrooms] do something nice. So far: great
success! Thanks again to everyone who helped and Jan for sponsoring a
case brewskis.

| @\ `samuirai <https://twitter.com/samuirai>`__ built this awesome
pixel nyan-cat. The project quickly evolved into a 8x8px prototype of a
nyan-snake game over the weekend. You can even control it using a NES
game-pad!

| An then there's Andy and his Mockman 2.0-based guitar amp. He layouted
the PCB in Eagle and printed it using our
`PCB-Printer <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:beta-layout:pcbprinter>`__.
