A little while ago @\ `dop3j0e <https://twitter.com/dop3j0e>`__ offered,
for the second time, an `SMD soldering
workshop <http://shackspace.de/?p=2784>`__. Contrary to the `previous
workshop <http://shackspace.de/?p=2555>`__, the boards were
professionally manufactured which made soldering even easier.
 Furthermore, version two of the workshop boards were even more tiny
than the previous ones!

I'm sure by now you're asking "Cut to the chase, what the heck *did* you
solder?"

It's @dop3j0e's
`TinyMega <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:tinymega>`__,
an ATmega32U4 breakout and prototyping board.

-  `ATmega32U4 <http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATMEGA32U4.aspx>`__-Controller
    32 KiB Flash
    2,5 KiB SRAM
    1 KiB EEPROM
    On-board USB-Controller (Low Speed, Full Speed, Host or Device)
-  Ultra-tiny footprint of just 39x22 mm
-  USB bootloader pre-loaded – super easy firmware loading over USB!
-  16 MHz clock frequency
-  Buttons for reset and entering bootloader mode
-  2 LEDs (green to indicate power, red optionally connected to a
   GPIO-pin)
-  All I/O pins of the microcontroller, including power, can be
   conveniently accessed via two rows of pin headers. The 2.54mm spacing
   perfectly fits your breadboard.
-  All pins, LEDs, buttons are conveniently labeled on the silkscreen.
-  Power over USB or external (5 V stabilized)
-  Dirt cheap -- total parts cost is around 8 EUR, excluding the PCB.
   (your mileage may vary depending on quantities ordered)

Also, there's lots of what every hacker is afraid of: Documentation!

-  The `Eagle project files are available on
   GitHub. <https://github.com/dop3j0e/eagle/tree/master/Atmega32U4-Breakout/v3>`__
-  There's also a `Bill of
   Materials. <https://github.com/dop3j0e/eagle/blob/master/Atmega32U4-Breakout/v3/bom.ods?raw=true>`__
-  We have English `step-by-step instructions on how to build the
   thing <https://github.com/dop3j0e/eagle/blob/master/Atmega32U4-Breakout/v3/instructions.pdf?raw=true>`__
-  and `more detailed
   information <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:tinymega>`__
   including a Hello World program on the shackspace Wiki (German).
