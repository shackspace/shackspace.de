|  Yesterday we were very lucky as
@\ `dop3j0e <https://twitter.com/#!/dop3j0e>`__\ walked in with a huge
`Hewlett Packard 54111D Digitizing
Oscilloscope <http://www.helmut-singer.de/stock/1073804467.html>`__
including 2x 3GHz probes. It is fully programmable with HP-IB !

We also recieved a `HP 6624A System DC power
supply <http://www.globaltestsupply.com/c/1/6624A_Power_Supply_40W_HP_Agilent.html>`__.
The power supply has some nice features such as programmability which
allows a voltage accuracy of up to 50mV. It is delivering 0-7V with
0-5A, 0-20V with 0-2A and 0-50V with 0-0.8A.

We would like to thank @\ `dop3j0e <https://twitter.com/#!/dop3j0e>`__
for his efforts and IBM for the kind donation.
