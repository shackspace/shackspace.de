Back in March this year
`layer1gfx <http://layer1gfx.carbonmade.com/>`__ did his second `Urban
Art Workshop <http://shackspace.de/?p=2890>`__ which was totally
fracking rad to say the least.   This time, over the the course of one
weekend five folks, three synchronized cameras and hundreds of euros
invested in a full rainbow spectrum of colors (including UV effect
colors) resulted in major upgrades to the shackspace staircase.

We now have: A big "Weltraum" style, a Bender spraycan, a UFO, an Angry
Bird, Tacgnol & Longcat, Krebs, Zoidberg, and Twilight Sparkle in space!

Here's the making off:
