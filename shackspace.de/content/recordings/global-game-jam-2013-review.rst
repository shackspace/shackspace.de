| We've had a great time `hosting this year's Global Game Jam <http://shackspace.de/?p=3707>`__ at shackspace.
|  Turns out that with 33 game developers, students, designers and musicians working on building games the Stuttgart Jam was one of the largest in Germany!

This years topic was "Heartbeat" and the Stuttgart event resulted in
seven games being developed in two days. Make sure to check them out,
most of them are implemented so you can play them right from your
browser.
