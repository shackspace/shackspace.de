| Last weekend, @\ `layer1gfx <https://twitter.com/layer1gfx>`__ held a Graffiti workshop at shackspace, with our own @\ `hdznrrd <https://twitter.com/hdznrrd>`__, @\ `momorientes <https://twitter.com/momorientes>`__ and @\ `samuirai <https://twitter.com/samuirai>`__ participating among others. The merry group of four aimed high when they planned a picture covering the whole back wall of our stair head.Â  While not participating himself, @\ `dop3j0e <https://twitter.com/dop3j0e>`__ documented the whole process, from white wall to final picture, using @\ `h0uz3 <https://twitter.com/h0uz3>`__'s Canon EOS 5D and an impromptu infrared intervalometer cobbled together from some parts we had lying around.
|  At one picture every five seconds, the whole process took some 7.500 photos, condensed to five minutes of timelapse for your viewing pleasure. So sit back and watch a wall being transformed into art!
