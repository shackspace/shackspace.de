| shackspace resident hacker `Robert <https://twitter.com/4rm4>`__ is at
it again. This time around he's built a new frame for this quad-copter.
|  In the past he's used everything from aluminium, carbon fiber to
3D-printed parts to build his copters and had mixed results (one
3D-printed copter\ `melted in the summer
heat <http://armageddon421.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AyvFn1YCQAEyvgq.jpg>`__ while
stored in his car).

Now he went with an `all-new plywood
design <http://armageddon421.de/?p=319>`__. The whole thing only weighs
in at 167 gramms and - despite being assembled without a single drop of
glue - is very sturdy.
