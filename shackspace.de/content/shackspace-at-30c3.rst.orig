The 30th Chaos Communication Congress (30C3) is an annual four-day
conference on technology, society and utopia. The Congress offers
`lectures <https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Static:Schedule>`__
and `workshops and various
events <https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Static:Self-organized_Sessions>`__
on a multitude of topics including (but not limited to) information
technology and generally a critical-creative attitude towards technology
and the discussion about the effects of technological advances on
society.

This year as well, shackspace is present with an even larger assembly
than last year. Drop by at congress and say hello!

For those of you who can't make it this year, there will be `live
streaming of most
lectures <https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Static:Documentation>`__.
