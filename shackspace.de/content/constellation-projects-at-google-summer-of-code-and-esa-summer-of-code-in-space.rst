|  Small projects can be important for space exploration and taken
serious by big names.
|  Google and ESA selected the participatory space group Constellation
for their Summer of Code campaigns in 2013.
|  These campaigns support open-source projects by connecting students
with organizations  and financially supporting the students while
coding.

If you've hung around shackspace for a bit you probably already know
about \ `Constellation <http://aerospaceresearch.net/constellation/>`__ and
`hgg <http://hgg.aero/>`__. This summer Google and ESA decided to
sponsor a few sub- and related projects in their respective Summer of
Code program!

|Constellation|

| `Constellation <http://aerospaceresearch.net/constellation/>`__'s goal
is to provide the creative environment for realization of different
aerospace projects.
|  For instance one branch of the group offers a distributed
super-computing platform for solving aerospace related numerical
problems. The massive computing power is provided by volunteers donating
their idle computing time at home by forming a virtual super-computer
via the internet. For this citizen space science method we are using
using the open-source software called
`BOINC <http://boinc.berkeley.edu/>`__ (Berkeley Open Interface for
Network Computing). Constellation is currently supported by 7000
volunteers providing 20000 host PCs to their computing grid.
|  With the Summer of Code campaigns Constellation wants to extend the
involvement of students in aerospace research and provide computing
power to their work.

| For Google Summer of Code \ `Constellation proposed diverse
applications <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/aerospaceresearchnet>`__
and at the time of writing this there's already three students working
on those projects.
|  The task at hand is to find the optimum interplanetary trajectory for
one probe to visit all eight planets of our solar system including Pluto
with a so called **Solar System Grand Tour**.

Also there's work to be done to support flying observatories like
`SOFIA <http://nasa.gov/sofia>`__ by NASA and DLR to maximize their
observation times by optimizing flight routes with project **Airborne
Observatory**.

And last but not least, there's a somewhat different project with an aim
to amaze children about all things space using an educational and fun
**Space Trumps** card game for Android mobile devices, so that they just
maybe choose a path in one of the
`STEM <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields>`__ professions once
they grow up.

But this is not all!

| For `ESA Summer of Code in
Space <http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2013/?q=node/13>`__ Constellation
is still looking for students who want to spend their summer with coding
and getting paid for doing so.
|  There are new ideas for tracking satellites with distributed ground
station networks for the `hackerspace global
grid <http://hgg.aero/>`__ program, creating a Peer-to-Peer based
computing grid and even a real ESA project to data-mine in terabytes of
science-data gathered by earth observation satellites.

If your are interested in space, citizen science and massive computing
power, you find our ideas on the `Constellation
webpage <http://aerospaceresearch.net/constellation/forum_thread.php?id=241>`__.
In case you don't find any project that's of interest to you on our
page, you should check the other 22 mentoring organizations. Being able
to support open-source projects is the power of citizen science, even on
a small scale!
