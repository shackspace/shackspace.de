As you `might have noticed <http://rescue.shackspace.de/>`__ almost one
and a half years ago, we had to leave our first location due to a large
and infamous construction project going on here in Stuttgart.  As you
hopefully also noticed, we're doing better than ever having found an
awesome and quite large location in March 2011.

Now these past days we got a sad reminder of the past and what was told
to happen finally happened.  The old location where shackspace spent its
first year was torn down.  With the building we've also lost our
`beloved mascot Bastelbert <http://shackspace.de/?p=1428>`__ which was
sprayed onto the front wall of the building.  Now all that's left is a
heap of rubble and many good memories.  Time to move on!
