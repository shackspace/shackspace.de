shack member *Mr. Pi* built this magnificently scary contraption of
industrial misappropriation.

What used to be the pump controller of a high-rise building's heating
system, is now an `8bit
adder <https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Adder_%28electronics%29>`__.
It comes with registers for input, storage and output; all conveniently
controlled via circuit breaker switches. Since this is industrial grade
hardware it's of course powered by 230V mains fed into the setup from a
wall socket via two banana jacks (note: we do have a mains circuit with
special safety features for fun like that at shackspace).
