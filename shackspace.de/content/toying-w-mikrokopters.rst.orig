|image0|\ Building a quad-copter was one of the early ideas/projects
around right at founding time of shackspace last year.
@\ `ansi <https://twitter.com/ansi>`__ and
@\ `hdznrrd <https://twitter.com/hdznrrd>`__ went ahead and both bought
a kit from `Mikrokopter <http://mikrokopter.de/>`__. After near-complete
assembly hdznrrd got sidetracked and ansi went on to other things.

Late 2010 hdznrrd revived his side of the project, bought missing parts
(receiver, remote control, chargers and extra LiPo packs) and got the
copter up and runni^W flying. In the meantime several quad-copter
enthusiasts visited and at times joined the fun flying around in front
of the space. Amongst them one copter using an
`Arduino <http://arduino.cc/>`__ as flight-controller.

The copter is already sporting a battery pouch made from duct tape, a
top-cover, and several smaller modifications. improvements, and fixed.

If you're interesting in messing around with flying, driving, swimming,
or diving toys of any kind come join the fun at shackspace!
