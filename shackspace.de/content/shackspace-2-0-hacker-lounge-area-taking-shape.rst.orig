| |image0|\ It was a very busy weekend indeed.
|  Removing the excess walls left in the new shackspace location by the
company who owned the building before turned out to be harder than
expected. The wall elements are anything but light-weight (estimates are
in the range of 80 to 90/kg per element). However, the hacker lounge and
seminar room areas are now properly opened up and the wall between
workshop, storage area, and electronics lab was left in for simplicities
sake.

After the huge `set-back ruining the floor of the
workshop <http://shackspace.de/?p=1846>`__ during carpet removal we
initially thought that this will not work.  However, another try with
the carpet covering the hacker lounge showed way better results.  The
carpet is fully gone with the screed undamaged.  There was still some
patches of old glue sticking to the floor but that was solved with power
tools and violence.
