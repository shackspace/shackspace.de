A while ago already, @\ `h0uz3 <https://twitter.com/h0uz3>`__ (*camera &
editing*) and @\ `hdznrrd <https://twitter.com/hdznrrd>`__ (*as Dr.
Nerd, Evil Genius and Alstair McFnord, Industrialist*) decided to create
a filmed tour of shackspace's new location.Â  They've joined forces with
@\ `rel0c8 <https://twitter.com/rel0c8>`__ (*as Armin*) to bring you the
following goody (in German):

`Shackrundgang 2.0 Beta <http://vimeo.com/24981263>`__ from `shack e.V.
Hackerspace Stuttgart <http://vimeo.com/shackspace>`__ on
`Vimeo <http://vimeo.com>`__.

Note: by now the lounge looks a lot better and there will be another
video showing the tons of changes that happened since the video was
shot. You can expect this some time after our opening party, which will
be in a week from now on Saturday, June 18th.

Also, outtakes:
