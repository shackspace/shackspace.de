|Symbolfoto| On the second-to-last weekend, our member @\ `dop3j0e <http://twitter.com/dop3j0e>`__ combined the wonders of Atmel microcontrollers, USB and surface-mount soldering in a workshop where participants could assemble their own development board based on Atmel's `ATmega32U4 <http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=4317&category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=760>`__ microcontroller: 32K flash, 2.5K RAM, 1K EEPROM, 16MHz and an integrated USB controller.

|Checking for shorts| Over the weekend, two groups of four participants each, who had never before soldered SMD, tried their luck under @dop3j0e's watchful eyes after a detailed introduction into the basic methods and tricks.

Sadly, the number of participants had to be reduced because @dop3j0e had
less parts in stock than expected, but that turned out to be a blessing
since the workshop took more than twice the alotted time on both days.
Hard-to-solder copper surfaces (note to self: don't use that old
chemical tinning next time), lifted pads and traces, accidental shorts
and several wrongly placed parts all took their toll on time, but with
patience and persistence, @dop3j0e helped all participants find and fix
the problems with their individual boards, so that everyone could walk
home with a working Atmel development platform. One participant had to
leave before his board could be fully fixed, but hope is not lost on him
-- he'll be back =)

With the overwhelming demand for this workshop and all the experience
made during this first iteration, there will be a second iteration soon,
this time with professionally manufactured PCBs and definitely enough
parts for everyone ;)
