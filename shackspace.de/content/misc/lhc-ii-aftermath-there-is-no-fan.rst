The folks of `RaumZeitLabor in Mannheim <http://raumzeitlabor.de/>`__
visited us and, with the meme "`there is no
fan <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=meme:there_is_no_fan>`__\ "
having been coined at the previous LHC held at their space, they brought
a simulacrum nofan made from an LED matrix panel with them.  While being
awesome it didn't blow hard enough.  Also there were safety concerns,
mainly having to do with the fact that LED matrix panels are inherently
safe, which is kind of boring.  We've rectified all of that.  `RZL went
home with a real
nofan <https://twitter.com/#!/Inte/status/107864486450438144>`__!  Watch
it in action:
