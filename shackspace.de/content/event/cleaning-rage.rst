| |image0|\ We'll be meeting on a regular basis at the space to clean up!
|  Nobody likes to work or hang out in a messy environment and lots of people produce lots of ... well, leftovers :)

Here's what we do:

-  Meet for an hour of cleaning-rage
-  Everyone gets a more or less randomly selected task assigned (there's
   single-person tasks and multiple-person tasks)
-  Do it
-  Feel good about it

The key thing here is: cleaning doesn't have to be a big ugly mess if
you do it often enough and if you don't have to do the same thing every
time.

Check out the `cleaning rage wiki
page <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:cleaningrage>`__ for
more details.

Be awesome!
