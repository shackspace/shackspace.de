It's camping time!

Chaos Computer Club will be camping out at
`Finowfurt <http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Location>`__ once again
for `CCCamp 2011 <http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Main_Page>`__ -
`Project Flow
Control <http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Project_Flow_Control>`__. 
There should still be `day and night passes
available <http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/More_Ticket_Options>`__
at the camp site.

Of course if it's awesome, we're there as well.  As usual the
organization is 23% non-existent, 42% chaos, 5% fail, and 29% random but
will clock in at around 9001 on the awesome-sauce scale.  Take a look
for yourself at our `camp wiki
page <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=camp>`__ (don't say I
haven't warned you).

If you're there, make sure to drop by the `Stuttgart 42
village <http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Stuttgart_42>`__ which will
be where most of the shackspace folks will hang out (with a probability
p = [0, 1]).

*In Fairy Dust We Trust!*
