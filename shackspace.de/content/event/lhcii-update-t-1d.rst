|image0|\ Good news everyone!  The shackspace hackerspace passport stamp arrived! And as a special bonus there's also a `Ministry of Cancer <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=ministry:cancer>`__ stamp on top of that.  So make sure to pack your passport and get two stamps for the price of one :)

Several folks around here started to drop camp beds and sleeping mats at
the space.  This means we'll have a couple of those for you on a on-site
first come first served basis.

We also have quite a number of `talks, workshops and
couches <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=event:lhc-ii:talks_workshops>`__
on the list already:

-  *Talk*: IPv6 bei einem ISP im WAN
-  *Talk*: Nutzen und Risiken der Bereitstellung von Internet-Zugängen
-  *Talk*: JavaScript im Jahr 2011
-  *Talk*: Penspinning
-  *Social Couch*: Ways to achieve 24/7 access to the hackspace
-  *Social Couch*: Patterns to get rid of waste and cleaning the space
-  *Social Couch*: How to build great teams and enable teamwork
-  *Social Couch*: All mail clients suck. All mailing list users suck.
   Why???
-  *Dev&Tech Couch*: Etching like a boss: What works, what doesn't
-  *Dev&Tech Couch*: Running IPv6 in the hackspace
-  *Dev&Tech Couch*: Storage for projects
-  *Dev&Tech Couch*: Soldering
-  *Workshop*: PCB Design for beginners
-  *Workshop*: Etching
-  *Workshop*: Soldering for beginners
-  *Workshop*: Just Fucking Shoot (Photography Workshop)
-  *Workshop*: Physical destruction of Blackberry smart phones
-  *Workshop*: Penspinning

If you want to give a talk and/or workshop, by all means, please add it
to the wiki page, you're free to edit it :)

We're also planning to cook some food on Saturday and Sunday as well as
prepare breakfast.  If you want to get your share, there will be a list
lying around on-site where you can put your name down :)
