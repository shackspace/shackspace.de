Live from shackspace: GSM-enthusiasts working on a setup involving
several old Motorola phones and `Neo
Freerunners <http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner>`__.

It's been brooding for some time now in the background but we've got a
growing group of hackers working with
`OsmocomBB <http://bb.osmocom.org/trac/>`__ and several models of
cellphones pulled of eBay and other sources. Currently most efforts are
spent on getting all phones up to date to arrive at a known and tested
mono-culture of devices which all behave in the same way. The red hooded
hacker (symbolic photo) is engaged in fearless firmware flashing working
towards that goal.

There's multiple Openmoko `Neo
Freerunners <http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner>`__ and
Motorola C123 available for hacking. One aim by some of our fellow
hackers is to find out whether or not a GSM phone can be connected to a
classic landline PBX setup while maintaining a GSM connection.

If you want to join the GSM hacking fun, just drop a mail to our `public
mailinglist <https://lists.shackspace.de/mailman/listinfo/public>`__ and
get in touch.
