|image0|\ shackspace's own @\ `dop3j0e <https://twitter.com/dop3j0e>`__,
known `for the many
hacks <http://prezi.com/dfmyygtuiqmn/von-holzchen-auf-stockchen/>`__ he
did at the space, just raised the bar.  A while ago he implemented
an\ `algorithmic piece of mus^W noise <http://shackspace.de/?p=2509>`__
as a C-one-liner inside an ATtiny9 all fitted inside an RCA plug.  That
little thing was dubbed the
"`Noiseplug <http://shackspace.de/?p=2509>`__\ " and was a great^W
annoying addition to liven up the shackspace lounge during those long
nightly hack sessions.

For this year's `Evoke demoscene party <http://www.evoke.eu/2012/>`__ in
Cologne which just concluded on Sunday, August 12th, he presented a
revamped version which replaced the C-one-liner noise with a proper
`chiptune <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune>`__.

The challenging part of the whole ordeal was the - quite literally -
tiny spec of the `ATtiny9 <http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATTINY9.aspx>`__
chip: 1kB flash memory, 32 bytes of RAM, 4 I/O pins.

However, leet assembler skillz (first time w/ AVR assembler) to the
rescue and a last minute competition day hack sprint of 7 hours resulted
in a polyphonic chiptune made up of a phat bassline (two oscillators),
catchy lead synth (three sawtooth oscillators), and arpeggio background
synth (one square wave oscillator).  It was `very well received by the
audience <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZpfHiwQf-s>`__ and ended up
`making 3rd place in the Wild / Alternative Platforms
Competition <http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL3830A3069DF94628&feature=player_detailpage&v=QnSc9VZcmS0#t=2228s>`__.

Of course dojoe wouldn't be living up to the hacker spirit if he didn't
share the source, so go ahead and `fork it on
GitHub <https://github.com/dop3j0e/noiseplug>`__!

An Atmel ATtiny9 playing chiptunes -- 1KB of flash, 32 bytes of RAM and
a 16 byte register file is all I have.
