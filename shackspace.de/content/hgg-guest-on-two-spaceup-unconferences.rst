|hgg\_earth\_rgb\_pos-72dpi|\ `Hackerspace Global
Grid <http://hgg.aero/>`__ (HGG) is a community driven project aiming to
build a distributed measurement platform with space applications. Would
there be a better place than space unconferences to present it? We, the
team behind HGG who are mostly shackspace members, thought “nay!” and
presented our distributed ground station network project for tracking
satellites on even two of those `SpaceUps <http://www.spaceup.org>`__ in
a row.

SpaceUp is a `barcamp <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp>`__ kind of
gathering where virtually everyone with enthusiasm for space can attend,
present and discuss space topics. And the best thing about those
unconferences is that the time schedule is formed directly during the
event itself by the participants themselves. So when you’re quick you
can just block a slot and have your space related talk. It’s an
unconventional conference, thus unconference.

SpaceUp Stuttgart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first one had been in our hometown at `SpaceUp
Stuttgart <http://www.spaceup.org/stuttgart>`__ in the `Space Center
Baden-Württemberg of the Institute of Space
Systems <http://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/index.en.html>`__ at the
`University of
Stuttgart <http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/home/index.en.html>`__ on 27th
October 2012. Germany’s first space unconference used this exquisite
location to bring together experts from the `European Space
Agency <http://www.esa.int/ESA>`__ (ESA), `German Aerospace
Center <http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/>`__ (DLR) and further faculties and
ordinary people just like us. As stated being part of the comic relief
part of the event we shared our enthusiasm for space science. And it
turned out very well and we received some great feedback and also
inspired the audience that a community based space project can have it’s
place between advanced mammothian space projects.

SpaceUp Bangalore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the Stuttgart event we had been contacted and kindly asked by the
organizers of `India’s first SpaceUp <http://www.spaceupindia.org>`__ if
we would like to send a video “Message from abroad” and we gratefully
replied “yea” and rushed in a video for their unconference in 1st
December. India’s efforts in furthering space technology is increasing
for the last several years and there are a lot of universities involved
in nano and small satellite projects. The SpaceUp India organizers
wanted us as an additional point of view for them that you can start
small and still achieve goals. And open-source and especially open-data
and education approaches are important objectives for India’s space
missions. So we share similar attitudes. Unluckily we couldn’t attend
ourselves and so had to send in a pre-recorded video for failsafe
reasons (Internet connections tend to hate live conferences, you know!)
but we received flattering reactions to our video and the organizers
told us the audience liked it.

So we say a big THANK YOU to both `SpaceUp
Stuttgart <http://www.spaceup.org/stuttgart>`__ and `SpaceUp
Bangalore <http://www.spaceupindia.org>`__. It had been a pleasure being
part of it and we’re eagerly looking forward for the next iterations. We
also kindly invite you to follow our HGG efforts on
`twitter <https://twitter.com/hxglobalgrid>`__, our
`mailinglist <https://lists.shackspace.de/mailman/listinfo/constellation>`__
or at `hgg.aero <http://hgg.aero/>`__ and help our grassroots space
program to achieve its goals.
