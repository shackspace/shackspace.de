|image0|\ The `International Space Apps
Challenge <http://spaceappschallenge.org/>`__ is your opportunity to
build, create, and invent new solutions to challenges of global
importance and shackspace is happy to announce that you can join this
effort `right here in
Stuttgart <http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/shackspace>`__,
Germany.  shackspace teamed up with AerospaceResearch.net to host a
`weekend long
hackathon <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:spaceappschallenge2012>`__ (shackspace
wiki).

| Among the many and still `growing numbers of
challenges <http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/>`__ there's also a
few thought up by our fellow colleagues of AerospaceResearch.net.
 `Brightest
Night <http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/brightest-night/>`__'s
aim is to build a network of webcams to measure the ever increasing
amount of light pollution introduced by growing urban areas and the
spread of civilization into the furthers reaches of formerly untouched
nature.  A fundamentally different question is posed by `Tour of the
Solar
System <http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/tour-solar-system/>`__
which tries to determine if and how it would be possible to visit all
the planets of our solar system with a simple Voyager class probe.
|  You're free to post your own ideas or pick any idea you want and work
on it.
