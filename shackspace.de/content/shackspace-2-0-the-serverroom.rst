| |image0|\ The ongoing renovation and expansion of shackspace also
allowed us to build a new home for our servers.
|  By now the server room walls are fully covered with sound insulation
foam to keep noise levels low in the rest of the space.
|  We also reverse engineered the former LAN-infrastructure of the
Building and pulled existing Cat5 (sadly, no Cat5e) cables down from the
2nd floor to our rooms in the 1st floor.
|  Now that the server room now is nearly ready for the racks we will
start to bring in 2 40RU racks for the servers and 1 smaller rack for
the network infrastructure.
|  Thanks to all the helpers who made it possible to get so far within a
few days.
