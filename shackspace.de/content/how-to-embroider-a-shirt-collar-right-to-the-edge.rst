Here at shackspace we've had a `Brother Innovis
90e <http://welcome.brother.com/ae-en/products-services/home-sewing-machines/innov-is-90e.html>`__
embroidery machine for a while now. We've decided to go for this model
because the colleagues of Mannheim's hackerspace
`RaumZeitLabor <http://raumzeitlabor.de/>`__ are using the same and had
a great experience with theirs.

| For 29C3 the folks behind `hgg <http://hgg.aero/>`__ decided they wanted their logo embroidered onto the collar of black business shirts.
|  However, we only have a medium size frame to hold fabric to be embroidered. This frame is too big to properly hold and support something as small as a shirt collar.
|  Of course there's also very small frames made just for this but they come at a price: you cannot place your motive close to the edge of the collar because the edge has to be clamped into the frame.

So shackspace member ttb developed `a technique explained in minute
detail in the shackspace
Wiki <http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=stickmaschine:hemdkragenbesticken>`__ that
enables us to embroider a shirt collar right to the edge using a medium
size frame.  He's fixing the collar inside the frame to a piece of
support fabric using a special water soluble glue. The glue will wash
out easily and can be obtained from your local sewing supply store.

| Here's a video (German) where ttb is demonstrating the technique:
