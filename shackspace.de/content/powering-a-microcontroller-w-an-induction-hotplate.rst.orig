| This is what Ulrich does on the weekend at shackspace.
|  *Normal* people use induction hotplates for cooking food.Â  We do that
as well of course but it's so much more fun using it with a `wireless
power
supply <http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/wireless-power-supply-p-701.html?cPath=155>`__
to power a Atmega8 microcontroller and some LEDs.
