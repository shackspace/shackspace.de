[![International space apps challenge](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/navbar-nav-logo.png)](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/navbar-nav-logo.png)shackspace is proud to support and host [AerospaceResearch.net](http://AerospaceResearch.net/) - a student team at the University of Stuttgart - in bringing back the [NASA Space Applications Challenge](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/location/stuttgart/) (Space Apps) to Stuttgart.
This year the goal is have a bigger, better event as well as a small head-start to give us a better chance at winning one of the awards ;). And we are inviting you to become a part of it!

On **Saturday** the **28th** of **February** at **18:00** o'clock you can join the _Kickoff_ event, start a team early and get your ideas in (the actual Space Apps event will be held in April).
Also, if everything works out well, participants can get a paper on their project published at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2015.

The AerospaceResearch.net team is working on the [Distributed Ground Station Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC4Ls3AGHf4) for tracking small satellites and it's proof-of-concept project [BigWhoop](https://github.com/aerospaceresearch/dgsn_bigwhoop), a global sensor grid for radio spectrum monitoring with software defined radio. You can either join the team or work on any of the other projects.

We [already hosted Space Apps in Stuttgart in 2012](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=3001) and it was a great event for working on space projects within an interdisciplinary team as well as for networking.
So feel invited to be part of this great space event and the global space community!

For more information just visit the kickoff event (there's a free case of Club Mate Cola!).
