It's camping time!

Chaos Computer Club will be camping out at [Finowfurt](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Location) once again for [CCCamp 2011](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Main_Page) - [Project Flow Control](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Project_Flow_Control).  There should still be [day and night passes available](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/More_Ticket_Options) at the camp site.

Of course if it's awesome, we're there as well.  As usual the organization is 23% non-existent, 42% chaos, 5% fail, and 29% random but will clock in at around 9001 on the awesome-sauce scale.  Take a look for yourself at our [camp wiki page](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=camp) (don't say I haven't warned you).

If you're there, make sure to drop by the [Stuttgart 42 village](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Stuttgart_42) which will be where most of the shackspace folks will hang out (with a probability p = [0, 1]).
