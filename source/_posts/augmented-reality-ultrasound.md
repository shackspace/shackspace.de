After the initial awesomeness subsided the machine started collecting dust in a corner.

Then [Victor](https://www.facebook.com/vskobov) visited us and asked if he could borrow the machine for a project idea he had. We decided to go one step further and made the machine a present to him.

Now Victor reported back in. The machine is working and he managed to implement his idea: **augmented reality ultrasound**!
