[![](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_20110825_093643-150x150.jpg "Hackerspace Passport Stamp")](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_20110825_093643.jpg)Good news everyone!  The shackspace hackerspace passport stamp arrived! And as a special bonus there's also a [Ministry of Cancer](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=ministry:cancer) stamp on top of that.  So make sure to pack your passport and get two stamps for the price of one :)

Several folks around here started to drop camp beds and sleeping mats at the space.  This means we'll have a couple of those for you on a on-site first come first served basis.
