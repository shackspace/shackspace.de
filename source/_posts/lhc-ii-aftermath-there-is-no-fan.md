The folks of [RaumZeitLabor in Mannheim](http://raumzeitlabor.de/) visited us and, with the meme "[there is no fan](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=meme:there_is_no_fan)" having been coined at the previous LHC held at their space, they brought a simulacrum nofan made from an LED matrix panel with them.  While being awesome it didn't blow hard enough.  Also there were safety concerns, mainly having to do with the fact that LED matrix panels are inherently safe, which is kind of boring.  We've rectified all of that.  [RZL went home with a real nofan](https://twitter.com/#!/Inte/status/107864486450438144)!  Watch it in action:
