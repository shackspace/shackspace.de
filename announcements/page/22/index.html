<p>Above video shows the Half-Life inspired dramatization of how to disassemble the classic German yellow phone booth (replicas only of course, and only for educational purposes).<br>It’s a piece of cake to take off the top, the door, even the floor.  There’s a very limited number of bolts that need to be removed by counter-boring to get the floor and top removed, everything else is held together by screws.  But once you’re left with the three remaining sides, things get tricky.<br>Here’s how you do it.</p>
<p>All round corners are clipped in place but the clip needs some force to get unclipped (the metal thing pried loose in the video is one half of the clip).<br>We’ll start off with the easiest of the four corner pieces, the door hinge.  You do not actually have to remove this part, but it’s first of all quite easy to do and it gives you nice insight into what the clip mechanism looks like, which is crucial to understand to allow you to remove the rear corner pieces.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the three screws holding the round corner piece of the door hinge in place.</li>
<li><p>The door hinge corner piece can be pried loose easily once the screws are removed (use crowbar).<br>Now, for the two rear pieces.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a crowbar to push the corner upwards by around 2 to 3cm.<br>You can do this by placing the crowbar between the rounded-off top of the rear corner and the two side walls and use it as a lever to push the corner upwards.</p>
</li>
<li>Force the crowbar down into the gap you just created and try to unclip the top most clip.</li>
<li>Start pulling on the corner piece in a diagonally outward direction.</li>
<li>While pulling, use the crowbar to pry each clip loose from top to bottom.</li>
<li>Once the corner piece is gone, remove the screws holding each clip in place.</li>
<li>The clips now pull right off the corner, allowing you to take the walls apart.<br>Disclaimer: two phone booth replicas have been slightly hurt in the making of this video.</li>
</ol>

For one there’s simply too much happening right now.</p>
<p>Good news: We accidentally the whole internet connection!<br>“The what?”, you say? Yes, the whole internet connection.<br>shackspace now has a 50/10Mbit line connected.  At first try on the advertised day on top of that.  Took some punching of the tech guys and various levels of social engineering using phone numbers you’re not usually supposed to call, but a team of fellow hackers managed to get everything in order.</p>
<p>Omnomnomnom is the word of the next item on the list.  A very short term (&lt;2h) decision one Monday night resulted in shackspace now having not only a softdri^W club-mate vending machine. No, we now have a snack vending machine!</p>
<p>We’ve also had significant upgrades on the storage front.  Large numbers of sheet metal selfs have been acquired off eBay at discount prices.  Finally enough storage space for all our stuff (for now).</p>
<p>The portal system is working again as well, at least for one of the two doors we  need to control.  Properly implementing the system for the outside door  will set us back at least 600 EUR.  Yikes.</p>

<p>This weekend we’ve managed to move everything we’ve planned to move in two days in just one single day.<br>Thanks a lot to everyone involved!  This would not have been possible without the help of a great many people.</p>
<p>A very special thanks goes out to everyone who donated to us, be it through PayPal, wire transfer or BitCoins.<br>You’re awesome!  We’ll be putting the donations to good use, paying for renovation, infrastructure, and moving costs.<br>If you would still like to donate something, <a href="http://rescue.shackspace.de/" target="_blank" rel="external">please do not hesitate</a> ;-)</p>
<p>From now on shackspace is located at:</p>
<p><strong>shack e.V.<br>Ulmer Straße 255<br>70327 Stuttgart-Wangen</strong></p>
<p>We’re still working on many details and are busy unpacking and setting up everything.  The shackspace open status monitor is not working yet (give the space a call at +49 (0)178 6624218 to check if it’s open), Internet is supposed to be hooked up some time next week, the WiFi door lock is not yet installed and there’s a lot of boxes piled up in the lounge.<br>Over the following days we’ll push out more info on what happened this past couple of weeks.  Photos were taken and videos recorded, there’s stories to be told.</p>
<p>Again, to everyone involved in whichever way:  Thank you, thank you so much!</p>

<p>On March 31st Deutsche Bahn (owner of the property) will close down the whole area around the old shackspace location at Stuttgart’s Nordbahnhof.  Everything still left in the location after that date is lost.<br>shackspace is on the move this weekend!</p>
<p>We’ve already rented a big truck and are ready to get everything done Friday/Saturday/Sunday this week (we kind of have to).<br>If you want to drop by and help out, come join us <strong>Saturday morning 10am</strong> sharp and <strong>Sunday 11am</strong> sharp at the old shackspace location (Äusserer Nordbahnhof 12).</p>
<p>If you want to join us, please let us know!  We’ve got a <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=umzug:todo-kw12" target="_blank" rel="external">wiki page set up</a> where we’ll be organizing this weeks workload.

Also the 42RU IBM racks are in position, which wasn’t as easy as it sounds since those things weigh easily over 100kg and are about two meters high.<br>We found out how to disassemble the racks so they’d fit into the elevator, transported them to the 1st floor and reassembled them in the server room.  But when we wanted to place the first server in the rack we noticed the whole rack had a width of 19” plus an extra ~10cm.  Now we need to find a way to “shrink” this IBM Blade Center rack to a 19” standard rack. If you have any hints for us don’t hesitate to drop us a comment below this post.</p>

The wall elements are anything but light-weight (estimates are in the range of 80 to 90/kg per element).  However,  the hacker lounge and seminar room areas are now properly opened up and the wall between workshop, storage area, and electronics lab was left in for simplicities sake.</p>
<p>After the huge <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=1846" target="_blank" rel="external">set-back ruining the floor of the workshop</a> during carpet removal we initially thought that this will not work.  However, another try with the carpet covering the hacker lounge showed way better results.  The carpet is fully gone with the screed undamaged.  There was still some patches of old glue sticking to the floor but that was solved with power tools and violence.</p>
