Also the 42RU IBM racks are in position, which wasn’t as easy as it sounds since those things weigh easily over 100kg and are about two meters high.<br>We found out how to disassemble the racks so they’d fit into the elevator, transported them to the 1st floor and reassembled them in the server room.  But when we wanted to place the first server in the rack we noticed the whole rack had a width of 19” plus an extra ~10cm.  Now we need to find a way to “shrink” this IBM Blade Center rack to a 19” standard rack. If you have any hints for us don’t hesitate to drop us a comment below this post.</p>
