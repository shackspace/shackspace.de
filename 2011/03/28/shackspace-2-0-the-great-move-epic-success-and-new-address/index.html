<p>This weekend we’ve managed to move everything we’ve planned to move in two days in just one single day.<br>Thanks a lot to everyone involved!  This would not have been possible without the help of a great many people.</p>
<p>A very special thanks goes out to everyone who donated to us, be it through PayPal, wire transfer or BitCoins.<br>You’re awesome!  We’ll be putting the donations to good use, paying for renovation, infrastructure, and moving costs.<br>If you would still like to donate something, <a href="http://rescue.shackspace.de/" target="_blank" rel="external">please do not hesitate</a> ;-)</p>
<p>From now on shackspace is located at:</p>
<p><strong>shack e.V.<br>Ulmer Straße 255<br>70327 Stuttgart-Wangen</strong></p>
<p>We’re still working on many details and are busy unpacking and setting up everything.  The shackspace open status monitor is not working yet (give the space a call at +49 (0)178 6624218 to check if it’s open), Internet is supposed to be hooked up some time next week, the WiFi door lock is not yet installed and there’s a lot of boxes piled up in the lounge.<br>Over the following days we’ll push out more info on what happened this past couple of weeks.  Photos were taken and videos recorded, there’s stories to be told.</p>
<p>Again, to everyone involved in whichever way:  Thank you, thank you so much!</p>
