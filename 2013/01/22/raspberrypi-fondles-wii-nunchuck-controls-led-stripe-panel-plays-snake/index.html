<p>shackspace hacker @<a href="https://twitter.com/4rm4" target="_blank" rel="external">4RM4</a> was looking for something to hack when he visited <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="external">29c3</a>. He found someone who was selling RGB-LED stripes with individually addressable LEDs which was (understandably) irresistible and he already had a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">RaspberryPi</a> to control it with. Controlling the stripe is done via one of the Pi’s SPI ports. However there was nothing to mount the stripe to… except for a trash bin.  Luckily the trash bin had a circumference of exactly 1 meter resulting in a 10 row high tubular display when he wrapped the 10 meters of LED stripe around it.</p>
<p>One of the first hacks was a text scroller which was nice but not quite there yet. But soon after that was done 4RM4 was off to the land of classic games and quickly hacked together a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game" target="_blank" rel="external">snake</a>) clone.  Playing snake on a tubular display was quite a challenge and since the trash bin had to stay at the congress center once 29c3 was over he opted to go for a more familiar and usable form factor by cutting the 10 meter LED stripe into smaller pieces to build a rectangular display.</p>
<p>He improved his snake clone by adding a high-score feature, auto-play bot, support for free dot placement for debugging, and a clock display in idle mode.</p>
<p>Playing it got even more fun with a Wii-Nunchuck hooked up to the RasPi which was quite easy since he could use the Pi’s GPIO port to talk to the Nunchuck’s I2C interface.</p>
<p>Of course the <a href="https://github.com/armageddon421/blinkenpi" target="_blank" rel="external">full code is available on GitHub</a> and there’s <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:blinkenpi" target="_blank" rel="external">some documentation (in German)</a> on the shackspace wiki.</p>
