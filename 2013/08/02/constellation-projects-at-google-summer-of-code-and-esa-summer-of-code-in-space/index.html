<p>If you’ve hung around shackspace for a bit you probably already know about <a href="http://aerospaceresearch.net/constellation/" target="_blank" rel="external">Constellation</a> and <a href="http://hgg.aero/" target="_blank" rel="external">hgg</a>. This summer Google and ESA decided to sponsor a few sub- and related projects in their respective Summer of Code program!</p>

<p><a href="http://aerospaceresearch.net/constellation/" target="_blank" rel="external">Constellation</a>‘s goal is to provide the creative environment for realization of different aerospace projects.<br>For instance one branch of the group offers a distributed super-computing platform for solving aerospace related numerical problems. The massive computing power is provided by volunteers donating their idle computing time at home by forming a virtual super-computer via the internet. For this citizen space science method we are using using the open-source software called <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">BOINC</a> (Berkeley Open Interface for Network Computing). Constellation is currently supported by 7000 volunteers providing 20000 host PCs to their computing grid.<br>With the Summer of Code campaigns Constellation wants to extend the involvement of students in aerospace research and provide computing power to their work.</p>
<p>For Google Summer of Code <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/aerospaceresearchnet" target="_blank" rel="external">Constellation proposed diverse applications</a> and at the time of writing this there’s already three students working on those projects.<br>The task at hand is to find the optimum interplanetary trajectory for one probe to visit all eight planets of our solar system including Pluto with a so called <strong>Solar System Grand Tour</strong>.</p>
<p>Also there’s work to be done to support flying observatories like <a href="http://nasa.gov/sofia" target="_blank" rel="external">SOFIA</a> by NASA and DLR to maximize their observation times by optimizing flight routes with project <strong>Airborne Observatory</strong>.</p>
<p>And last but not least, there’s a somewhat different project with an aim to amaze children about all things space using an educational and fun <strong>Space Trumps</strong> card game for Android mobile devices, so that they just maybe choose a path in one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields" target="_blank" rel="external">STEM</a> professions once they grow up.</p>

<p>But this is not all!</p>
<p>For <a href="http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2013/?q=node/13" target="_blank" rel="external">ESA Summer of Code in Space</a> Constellation is still looking for students who want to spend their summer with coding and getting paid for doing so.<br>There are new ideas for tracking satellites with distributed ground station networks for the <a href="http://hgg.aero/" target="_blank" rel="external">hackerspace global grid</a> program, creating a Peer-to-Peer based computing grid and even a real ESA project to data-mine in terabytes of science-data gathered by earth observation satellites.</p>
<p>If your are interested in space, citizen science and massive computing power, you find our ideas on the <a href="http://aerospaceresearch.net/constellation/forum_thread.php?id=241" target="_blank" rel="external">Constellation webpage</a>. In case you don’t find any project that’s of interest to you on our page, you should check the other 22 mentoring organizations. Being able to support open-source projects is the power of citizen science, even on a small scale!</p>
