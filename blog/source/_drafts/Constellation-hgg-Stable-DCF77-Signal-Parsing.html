<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/hdznrrd/status/131064143464775680">a really stupid setback</a> courtesy of Conrad Electronic this Monday @<a href="https://twitter.com/rel0c8">rel0c8</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/hdznrrd">hdznrrd</a> set out to build a <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:hgg:timing_and_synchronization">time source</a> for the Constellation distributed groundstation project.</p>
<p>Existing code was discarded partly because we can and mostly because what we found didn&#39;t suit our requirements: high stability, noise tolerance, as well as getting an in-depth understanding of how it worked.</p>
<p>The receiver is a <a href="http://www.conrad.de/ce/de/product/641138/DCF-EMPFAENGERPLATINE/SHOP_AREA_17348&amp;promotionareaSearchDetail=005">DCF module sold by Conrad</a> connected to an Arduino board.  The <a href="https://github.com/shackspace/hgg/tree/master/hardware/dcf77">firmware</a> is still a work in progress but first tests showed good and stable results.</p>
