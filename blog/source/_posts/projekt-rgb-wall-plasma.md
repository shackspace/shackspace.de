[4rm4](https://twitter.com/4rm4) is at it again! A while ago he built a nice [RGB wall display driven by a RaspberryPi](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=3826) which brought great joy to the space because you could use it to play the classic game of snake using a Wii nun-chuck connected to it.

This time it's less interactive but adds a serious amount of eyecandy to the shackspace lounge. He incorporated code from [dop3j0e](https://twitter.com/dop3j0e)'s [16x16 LED plasma display](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=1815), tweaked the parameters a bit and added mapping to the full color range of the larger display.

This is [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) by example: share what you've learned and made and maybe 3 years down the road someone will re-use it and add (rainbows) to it.
