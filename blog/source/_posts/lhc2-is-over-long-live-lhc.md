We've had a blast!  It was great seeing so many fellow hackerspace folks at the space.  We've even had a visitor that told us he heard about us from [MAKE zine](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/08/hackerspace-happenings-pittsburgh-mmf-call-for-makers.html).  Not sure how we ended up there.  Awesome!

We would like to thank everyone who visited, contributed, hacked, talked, presented stuff, offered workshops, brought awesome gear and experimental drinks (Club-Mate wine was awesome! Go RaumZeitLabor!).  The event was as awesome because all of you made it that way!

If you hacked anything, took photos, or have an anecdote or two, please let us know (send a mail to hadez a-t shackspace.de) and we'll assemble everything into a follow-up post here on the blog.

We've had a lot of people at the space and quite some hackerspaces were represented.  In no particular order (and I might have missed one or two): [c-base](https://www.c-base.org/), [sublab](http://sublab.org/), [c3d2](http://c3d2.de/), [RaumZeitLabor](http://raumzeitlabor.de/), [syn2cat](http://www.hackerspace.lu/), [Chaostreff Tübingen](http://chaostreff-tuebingen.de/), [Kreativität trifft Technik Oldenburg](http://blog.kreativitaet-trifft-technik.de/), ECC, [c3pb / subraum](https://www.c3pb.de/), [entropia](https://entropia.de/Hauptseite).
