[![](https://blog.shackspace.de/gallery/var/thumbs/Umzug-nach-0xff/IMG_1127.JPG)](https://blog.shackspace.de/gallery/index.php/Umzug-nach-0xff/IMG_1127)It was a very busy weekend indeed.
Removing the excess walls left in the new shackspace location by the company who owned the building before turned out to be harder than expected.  The wall elements are anything but light-weight (estimates are in the range of 80 to 90/kg per element).  However,  the hacker lounge and seminar room areas are now properly opened up and the wall between workshop, storage area, and electronics lab was left in for simplicities sake.

After the huge [set-back ruining the floor of the workshop](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=1846) during carpet removal we initially thought that this will not work.  However, another try with the carpet covering the hacker lounge showed way better results.  The carpet is fully gone with the screed undamaged.  There was still some patches of old glue sticking to the floor but that was solved with power tools and violence.
