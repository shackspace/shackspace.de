[![img_7233-h400](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/img_7233-h400.jpg)](https://blog.shackspace.de/projects/chris/bakelit-u-i-meter/)At shackspace we have a "take away" shelf where various items slowly accumulate and are free for the taking.

One such item was a pre-war precision voltage and current meter. The "little" gem is around 30x20 cm in size and weighs in at something between 4 to 5 kg and comes in a [Bakelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakelite) case. Clearly designed to last forever.

Sadly though not _quite_ forever. The probe connector terminals were broken off.

No problem for shackspace hacker chris who took to the broken device, searched for replacement parts and in the end had to turn adapters on his lathe to make the biggest connectors he could find fit the even bigger holes of the ancient device.

There's also a [full writeup (in German) with tons of tech-porn photographs for your enjoyment](https://blog.shackspace.de/projects/chris/bakelit-u-i-meter/).
