It's going to happen with a probability close to 1 (yes, this means it _will_ happen!)

Date: **Friday 26th **(18:00)** to Sunday 28th August 2011**

Hackers from several hackerspaces will meet up at shackspace for the second installment of the [Large Hackerspace Convention](https://blog.shackspace.de/lhcii).
If you have not yet [signed up](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=event:lhc-ii:anmeldung), please do so.  After all, it's free!  This will help us a great deal in planning more accurately (while still maintaining low-orga-level planning efforts :D).

There will also be a soldering, etching, and pcb-design [workshop](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=event:lhc-ii:talks_workshops#workshops) by slopjong of syn2cat hackerspace, if you want to attend, [please put your name down](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=event:lhc-ii:talks_workshops#workshops) in the wiki!
If you want to give a talk and already know about what you want to talk, please just [put it on the list](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=event:lhc-ii:talks_workshops#talks).

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to sign up for the [LHC mailing list](https://lists.shackspace.de/mailman/listinfo/lhcii).
