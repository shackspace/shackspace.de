shackspace resident hacker [Robert](http://armageddon421.de/) has been hacking around quad and hexacopters for quite some time now.
Recently he upgraded his hexa with a nice first person view (FPV) rig.

To honor this milestone he's written up an article outline the history of the build, [from zero to FPV on his blog](http://armageddon421.de/?p=297). Make sure to check out the video recording of this first FPV flight embedded blow and his blog post for all the details!
