After near-complete assembly hdznrrd got sidetracked and ansi went on to other things.</p>
<p>Late 2010 hdznrrd revived his side of the project, bought missing parts (receiver, remote control, chargers and extra LiPo packs) and got the copter up and runni^W flying. In the meantime several quad-copter enthusiasts visited and at times joined the fun flying around in front of the space. Amongst them one copter using an <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> as flight-controller.</p>
<p>The copter is already sporting a battery pouch made from duct tape, a top-cover, and several smaller modifications. improvements, and fixed.</p>
