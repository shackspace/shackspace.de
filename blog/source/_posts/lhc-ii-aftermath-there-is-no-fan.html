<p>The folks of <a href="http://raumzeitlabor.de/">RaumZeitLabor in Mannheim</a> visited us and, with the meme &quot;<a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=meme:there_is_no_fan">there is no fan</a>&quot; having been coined at the previous LHC held at their space, they brought a simulacrum nofan made from an LED matrix panel with them.  While being awesome it didn&#39;t blow hard enough.  Also there were safety concerns, mainly having to do with the fact that LED matrix panels are inherently safe, which is kind of boring.  We&#39;ve rectified all of that.  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Inte/status/107864486450438144">RZL went home with a real nofan</a>!  Watch it in action:</p>
