@[tensau](https://twitter.com/tensau) has been working on this for a while already but it's time to make it official:  shackspace? There's an app for that!

You might be thinking: What does a hackerspace need an app for?  Well, let me tell you what it does:

*   shack status, check whether the space is open or not (there's also a widget for this)
*   Turn off (and on) individual ceiling lights in the shackspace lounge
*   Quick-links to relevant communication channels + built in navigation
*   Our vending machine crew can update the bookkeeping software while they're re-filling the vending machines by scanning product barcodes and QR-codes
*   A simple blog viewer
Features to be introduces with one of the next versions will be:

*   Access to the wireless door lock to open the door with the press of a single button
*   Better blog viewer
*   Revamped GUI
