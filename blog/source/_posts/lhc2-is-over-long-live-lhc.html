<p>We&#39;ve had a blast!  It was great seeing so many fellow hackerspace folks at the space.  We&#39;ve even had a visitor that told us he heard about us from <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2011/08/hackerspace-happenings-pittsburgh-mmf-call-for-makers.html">MAKE zine</a>.  Not sure how we ended up there.  Awesome!</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who visited, contributed, hacked, talked, presented stuff, offered workshops, brought awesome gear and experimental drinks (Club-Mate wine was awesome! Go RaumZeitLabor!).  The event was as awesome because all of you made it that way!</p>
<p>If you hacked anything, took photos, or have an anecdote or two, please let us know (send a mail to hadez a-t shackspace.de) and we&#39;ll assemble everything into a follow-up post here on the blog.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve had a lot of people at the space and quite some hackerspaces were represented.
