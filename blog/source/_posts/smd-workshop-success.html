<p>Sadly, the number of participants had to be reduced because @dop3j0e had less parts in stock than expected, but that turned out to be a blessing since the workshop took more than twice the alotted time on both days. Hard-to-solder copper surfaces (note to self: don&#39;t use that old chemical tinning next time), lifted pads and traces, accidental shorts and several wrongly placed parts all took their toll on time, but with patience and persistence, @dop3j0e helped all participants find and fix the problems with their individual boards, so that everyone could walk home with a working Atmel development platform. One participant had to leave before his board could be fully fixed, but hope is not lost on him -- he&#39;ll be back =)</p>
<p>With the overwhelming demand for this workshop and all the experience made during this first iteration, there will be a second iteration soon, this time with professionally manufactured PCBs and definitely enough parts for everyone ;)</p>
