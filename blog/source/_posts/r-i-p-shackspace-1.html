<p>As you <a href="http://rescue.shackspace.de/">might have noticed</a> almost one and a half years ago, we had to leave our first location due to a large and infamous construction project going on here in Stuttgart.  As you hopefully also noticed, we&#39;re doing better than ever having found an awesome and quite large location in March 2011.</p>
<p>Now these past days we got a sad reminder of the past and what was told to happen finally happened.  The old location where shackspace spent its first year was torn down.  With the building we&#39;ve also lost our <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=1428">beloved mascot Bastelbert</a> which was sprayed onto the front wall of the building.  Now all that&#39;s left is a heap of rubble and many good memories.  Time to move on!</p>
