<p>We did it!</p>
<p>This weekend we&#39;ve managed to move everything we&#39;ve planned to move in two days in just one single day.
Thanks a lot to everyone involved!  This would not have been possible without the help of a great many people.</p>
<p>A very special thanks goes out to everyone who donated to us, be it through PayPal, wire transfer or BitCoins.
You&#39;re awesome!  We&#39;ll be putting the donations to good use, paying for renovation, infrastructure, and moving costs.
If you would still like to donate something, <a href="http://rescue.shackspace.de/">please do not hesitate</a> ;-)</p>
<p>From now on shackspace is located at:</p>
<p><strong>shack e.V.
Ulmer Stra√üe 255
70327 Stuttgart-Wangen</strong></p>
<p>We&#39;re still working on many details and are busy unpacking and setting up everything.  The shackspace open status monitor is not working yet (give the space a call at +49 (0)178 6624218 to check if it&#39;s open), Internet is supposed to be hooked up some time next week, the WiFi door lock is not yet installed and there&#39;s a lot of boxes piled up in the lounge.
Over the following days we&#39;ll push out more info on what happened this past couple of weeks.  Photos were taken and videos recorded, there&#39;s stories to be told.</p>
<p>Again, to everyone involved in whichever way:  Thank you, thank you so much!</p>
