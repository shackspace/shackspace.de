<p>Here at shackspace we&#39;ve had a <a href="http://welcome.brother.com/ae-en/products-services/home-sewing-machines/innov-is-90e.html">Brother Innovis 90e</a> embroidery machine for a while now. We&#39;ve decided to go for this model because the colleagues of Mannheim&#39;s hackerspace <a href="http://raumzeitlabor.de/">RaumZeitLabor</a> are using the same and had a great experience with theirs.</p>
<p>For 29C3 the folks behind <a href="http://hgg.aero/">hgg</a> decided they wanted their logo embroidered onto the collar of black business shirts.
However, we only have a medium size frame to hold fabric to be embroidered. This frame is too big to properly hold and support something as small as a shirt collar.
Of course there&#39;s also very small frames made just for this but they come at a price: you cannot place your motive close to the edge of the collar because the edge has to be clamped into the frame.</p>
<p>So shackspace member ttb developed <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=stickmaschine:hemdkragenbesticken">a technique explained in minute detail in the shackspace Wiki</a> that enables us to embroider a shirt collar right to the edge using a medium size frame.  He&#39;s fixing the collar inside the frame to a piece of support fabric using a special water soluble glue. The glue will wash out easily and can be obtained from your local sewing supply store.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a video (German) where ttb is demonstrating the technique:</p>
