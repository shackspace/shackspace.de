Space Apps is an international hackathon that occurs over 48 hours in cities around the world. Because of citizens like you, we continue to grow each year. If you haven't already, join us to share ideas and engage with open data to address real-world problems, on Earth and in space. Work alone or with a team to solve challenges that could help change the world. And everybody can help, diverse backgrounds (software developers, engineers, artists, journalists, hackers, makers,...) will provide unique solutions to global problems that nobody thought about before. Check back here to join Space Apps in the Stuttgart hackerspace shackspace.
