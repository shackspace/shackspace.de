<p>Dave Jones of <a href="http://www.eevblog.com/">EEVblog</a> enjoys somewhat of a following among shackspace members. We really love his blog and videos. Since we know he loves everything from the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_future">Back To The Future</a> Universe we wanted to get him something to further complete his collection.</p>
<p>The chance to do exactly this arose when our friends over at <a href="http://www.pcb-pool.com/">PCB-Pool</a> approached us last year (2012). They were in the process of planning their 2012 <a href="http://www.electronica.de/">Electronica trade show</a> booth and already had sourced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine">DeLorean</a> (sadly, without working time machine). One of the crucial parts missing was the dashboard clock used to display the time coordinates. Since PCB-Pool is, well, a PCB manufacturer and not really a design-house they approached us and asked if we would be willing to make their show appearance a bit more awesome than usual.</p>
<p>shackspace hackers <a href="http://twitter.com/timmedia">Timm</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dop3j0e">Jocki</a> immediately started working their magic.</p>
<p>The clock is made up of</p>
<ul>
<li>three identical (except for LED color), daisy-chainable display boards each holding a bunch of 7-segment (date and time) and 16-segment (name of month) displays driven by a TLC59282 constant-current driver,</li>
<li>an Arduino shield that holds a real-time clock (RTC) to keep accurate time,</li>
<li>an aluminium front panel silkscreened with the clock&#39;s design and</li>
<li>firmware to bring everything together.
The clock was quite the show piece at Electronica and PCB-Pool was really happy with the way it turned out.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few weeks ago we&#39;ve approached them again and asked if they would be willing to run another set of PCBs and print another front plate so we could send one to His Craziness Dave &#39;EEVblog&#39; Jones. They agreed, a few fellow hackers chipped in and we&#39;ve sourced the electronic components, soldered everything together, wrote a nice letter to go with it, packaged it up and sent it off on the long way down under to Australia.</p>
<p>We already got a bit jittery when the package was spotted in one of Dave&#39;s previous videos, sitting on his self.
Various amounts of panic were then caused when <a href="https://twitter.com/eevblog/status/373647994291105793">Dave announced</a> that he blew up &quot;a super cool mailbag item&quot;. We calmed down a bit, telling ourselves that his mailbag pile is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO">FIFO</a> and he gets a lot of items, so we&#39;re probably safe.
Then this week&#39;s mailbag video (below) arrived and our worst fears became reality: Dave switched to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_(computing">LIFO</a>) mode opening the more recent packages first and, during plugging everything together, really did blow up the BTTF clock we&#39;ve sent him :(</p>
<p>Lesson learned: always, <em>ALWAYS</em> mark pin 1 on your connectors.</p>
<p>Anyway, the issue is one or maybe two blown TLCs which should be fairly simple to replace. Still, it&#39;s quite a bummer it blew. And to be honest, we&#39;re a tiny bit embarrassed for using the pin headers in stead of the proper boxed headers. That&#39;s what happens if you&#39;re out of that one last part and really want to get it shipped. &quot;It&#39;ll be fine!&quot; turns into &quot;Oh crap&quot; thanks to good old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy</a> with 100% certainty. ;)</p>
<p>We hope Dave can get it fixed (we&#39;re actually certain of that!) and wish him a lot of fun with his new clock.</p>

Now, without further ado, here&#39;s Dave&#39;s mailbag video (the fun starts at 5:00):</li>
