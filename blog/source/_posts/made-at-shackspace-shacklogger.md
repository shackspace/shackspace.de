We've had a [shackspace tumblr](http://log.shackspace.de) account for a while now (you might have noticed the widget to the right of this article) but accessing it wasn't that easy workflow-wise.

Now, thanks to resident hacker [makefu](https://twitter.com/makefoo) - who sponsored his old Nexus 4 phone - there's [shacklogger](http://log.shackspace.de/post/109319093546/introducing-the-shacklogger-makefu-wants-to). You can simply snap a photo or record a brief video of your project, write a few short lines of description and directly upload it to the log.shackspace.de tumblr account for the world to see!
