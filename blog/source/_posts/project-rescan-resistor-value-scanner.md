A while ago one of our own, [Robert](http://armageddon421.de/), was faced with the gruesome task of sorting through a pile of resistors.
Being way better at pounding machines into submissions to do his bidding than remembering resistor color codes, he decided to build an Android App (Windows version available as well) that uses the cellphone camera to scan and identify resistors.
To make it even easier and keep you from reading the phones display, it uses text to speech software to read the detected value out loud.

The [code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/armageddon421/ResCan) and there's also[ binary releases for Windows](https://github.com/armageddon421/ResCan/releases).

Happy sorting, everyone!
