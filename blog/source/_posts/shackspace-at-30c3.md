The 30th Chaos Communication Congress (30C3) is an annual four-day conference on technology, society and utopia. The Congress offers [lectures](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Static:Schedule "Static:Schedule") and [workshops and various events](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Static:Self-organized_Sessions "Static:Self-organized Sessions") on a multitude of topics including (but not limited to) information technology and generally a critical-creative attitude towards technology and the discussion about the effects of technological advances on society.

This year as well, shackspace is present with an even larger assembly than last year. Drop by at congress and say hello!
