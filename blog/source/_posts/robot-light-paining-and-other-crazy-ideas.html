<p><a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=leute:excogitation">Christian</a> had some left-overs at work, amongst which there was also a quite dated Mitsubishi Movemaster RM-101 educational robot which we immediately named <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:nr5">Number 5</a>.  It&#39;s a 5-axis robot arm built back in 1984 or something, wasn&#39;t in the best shape and nothing much was known about it.  The internet seems to be devoid of information on this piece of hardware, except that &quot;yes, it does exist&quot; and &quot;no, there&#39;s no manual&quot;.</p>
<p>A first glance at the hardware showed that it was connected via a parallel printer port and the controller doing the magic is a Z80 mikrocontroller.  One of the things decided upon early in the process was creating a backup of the EPROM holding the program code before it dies.  This was easily possible thanks to @<a href="https://twitter.com/grftjx">grftjx</a>&#39;s help using his trusty <a href="http://www.zeitech.de/Willem-True-USB-V2-Universal-Programmiergeraet">Willem True</a> universal programmer board.</p>
<p>The lack of documentation picked the interest of @<a href="https://twitter.com/dop3j0e">dop3j0e</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/samuirai">samuirai</a> who started working through the now dumped Z80 assembler code with tactical precision using <a href="http://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml">IDAPro</a> and and an instruction set manual.  After some probing around the firmware sources the <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:nr5#reversing_der_firmware">most important commands</a> to move the robot arm around where identified.</p>
<p>Since the parallel port connector seemed to be neither original nor functional it was <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:nr5#db25_con3">both fixed and documented</a>.</p>
<p>It was now time to get the thing moving, so <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=leute:chris">chris</a> replaced the problem of a non-moving robot arm with a <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:nr5#scripte">tiny shell script</a>.</p>
<p>Now that all the reversing was done, Christian remembered that there was in fact a dusty old copy of the instruction manual back at the company.  The manual quickly confirmed everything that was reversed and gave a bit more insight into the <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:nr5#befehle_rm-501">other commands the robot accepted</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, let us pause for a second and watch this video courtesy of our chief videographer @<a href="https://twitter.com/h0uz3">h0uz3</a> supported by art director <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=leute:papachaotica">papachaotica</a> of the robot arm in action:</p>

<p>Okay, thanks for watching, now back to more awesomeness.</p>
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/4rm4">4rm4</a> joined the fun with actual applications!  Introducing: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mGBhP#0">robot</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mGBhP#2">powered</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mGBhP#3">light</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mGBhP#4">painting</a>!  And robot powered <a href="https://p.twimg.com/AwOJ7lhCAAEAY84.jpg:large">plotting using a felt pen</a>.</p>
<p>At this point you&#39;re probably thinking: &quot;Nice, but a little small, eh?&quot;.  Fear not, <a href="https://twitter.com/4RM4/status/215928983873794048/photo/1">we&#39;ve got the size issue covered</a>.</p>
