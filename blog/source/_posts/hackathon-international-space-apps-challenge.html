<p>Among the many and still <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">growing numbers of challenges</a> there&#39;s also a few thought up by our fellow colleagues of AerospaceResearch.net.  <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/brightest-night/">Brightest Night</a>&#39;s aim is to build a network of webcams to measure the ever increasing amount of light pollution introduced by growing urban areas and the spread of civilization into the furthers reaches of formerly untouched nature.  A fundamentally different question is posed by <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/tour-solar-system/">Tour of the Solar System</a> which tries to determine if and how it would be possible to visit all the planets of our solar system with a simple Voyager class probe.
You&#39;re free to post your own ideas or pick any idea you want and work on it.</p>
