<p><a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ubnt_logo_basic_flat_color.png"><img src="https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ubnt_logo_basic_flat_color.png" alt="ubnt_logo_basic_flat_color"></a>Over a year ago shackspace migrated its Wifi infrastructure to an all-Ubiquiti setup because our previous setup made up of consumer grade TP-Link access points was neither stable nor could it cope with enough clients to cover 30+ visitors to the space. We&#39;ve decided to pick up a few UniFi access points and were really happy with the ease of installation as well as management capabilities.</p>
<p>However, this wouldn&#39;t be a hackerspace if there wasn&#39;t someone applying a bit more scrutiny than usual to the new toys.
In this case it was shackspace hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/momorientes">momo</a> who soon discovered a serious flaw in the UniFi controller management web interface.</p>
<p>After following the best practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">responsible disclosure</a>, now, a year later, momo can talk about the details behind the issue.
A fix for the bug discovered has already made its way into updates quite a while ago so if you kept your infrastructure up to date, you&#39;re already safe from that particular bug.</p>
<p>The bug in question allowed an attacker to forge a special DHCP hostname (e.g. containing HTML and Javascript code) and inject this information into the UniFi controller web interface where it was then executed.</p>
<p>The issue was assigned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a>-2013-3572 and was just now released. If you&#39;re still running UniFi 2.3.5 or older, now&#39;s a good time to update ;)</p>
