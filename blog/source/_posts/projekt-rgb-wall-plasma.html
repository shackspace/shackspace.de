<p><a href="https://twitter.com/4rm4">4rm4</a> is at it again! A while ago he built a nice <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=3826">RGB wall display driven by a RaspberryPi</a> which brought great joy to the space because you could use it to play the classic game of snake using a Wii nun-chuck connected to it.</p>
<p>This time it&#39;s less interactive but adds a serious amount of eyecandy to the shackspace lounge. He incorporated code from <a href="https://twitter.com/dop3j0e">dop3j0e</a>&#39;s <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=1815">16x16 LED plasma display</a>, tweaked the parameters a bit and added mapping to the full color range of the larger display.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> by example: share what you&#39;ve learned and made and maybe 3 years down the road someone will re-use it and add (rainbows) to it.</p>
