[![](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/usbasp-300x225.jpg "USBasp")](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/usbasp.jpg)shack member Michael built his [own version](http://www.mupfelofen.de/?post/2011/02/14/USBasp) of the famous [USBasp](http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/) by Thomas Fischl.

But it's not just yet another USBasp implementation. This little gem is a true single-sided PCB without any bridges, all through-hole components and still maintains a very compact footprint of merely 55mm x 75mm.

This is a very easy to build [AVR](http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/)-programmer suitable even for beginners.

Simply grab the [source for the project](http://www.mupfelofen.de/public/projects/usbasp-1.0.tgz) and start making your own!
