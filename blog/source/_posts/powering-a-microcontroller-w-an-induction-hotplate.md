This is what Ulrich does on the weekend at shackspace.
_Normal_ people use induction hotplates for cooking food.Â  We do that as well of course but it's so much more fun using it with a [wireless power supply](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/wireless-power-supply-p-701.html?cPath=155) to power a Atmega8 microcontroller and some LEDs.
