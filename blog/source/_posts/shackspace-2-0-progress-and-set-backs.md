[![](https://blog.shackspace.de/gallery/var/thumbs/Umzug-nach-0xff/IMG_0195.jpg?m=1299369337)](https://blog.shackspace.de/gallery/index.php/Umzug-nach-0xff/IMG_0195)Late Friday afternoon and all of Saturday we were hard at work at the new shackspace location, moving walls and trying to get the old (and admittedly kind of disgusting) office carpet removed.

Removing the walls is pretty tedious but well manageable working in teams.  However, we noticed that that removing the walls was not possible without causing some damage to ceiling, pillars and flooring which we'll have to fix later on.

The first image is a partial view of the largest room we'll have, the open hacker's lounge.  The lounge will cover almost the same space as the whole of shackspace 1.0 (100 to 120sqm), so everyone can look forward to a nice, big, central community area.

With the tools we currently have access to it turns out that getting the carpet out in just one weekend won't be happening.  As always, work in progress :)

We've also set up a [gallery specifically for the move](https://blog.shackspace.de/gallery/index.php/Umzug-nach-0xff) to the new location dubbed _0xff_ (the address is Ulmer Strasse 255).  There should be more photos coming in over the next few days.
