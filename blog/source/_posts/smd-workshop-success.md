[![Checking for shorts](https://blog.shackspace.de/gallery/var/thumbs/Menschen%2C-Daten%2C-Sensationen/SMD-Workshop-2011-11-04-05/DSC_6309.jpg)](https://blog.shackspace.de/gallery/index.php/Menschen-Daten-Sensationen/SMD-Workshop-2011-11-04-05) Over the weekend, two groups of four participants each, who had never before soldered SMD, tried their luck under @dop3j0e's watchful eyes after a detailed introduction into the basic methods and tricks.

Sadly, the number of participants had to be reduced because @dop3j0e had less parts in stock than expected, but that turned out to be a blessing since the workshop took more than twice the alotted time on both days. Hard-to-solder copper surfaces (note to self: don't use that old chemical tinning next time), lifted pads and traces, accidental shorts and several wrongly placed parts all took their toll on time, but with patience and persistence, @dop3j0e helped all participants find and fix the problems with their individual boards, so that everyone could walk home with a working Atmel development platform. One participant had to leave before his board could be fully fixed, but hope is not lost on him -- he'll be back =)

With the overwhelming demand for this workshop and all the experience made during this first iteration, there will be a second iteration soon, this time with professionally manufactured PCBs and definitely enough parts for everyone ;)
