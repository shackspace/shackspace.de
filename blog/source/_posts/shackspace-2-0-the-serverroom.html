By now the server room walls are fully covered with sound insulation foam to keep noise levels low in the rest of the space.
We also reverse engineered the former LAN-infrastructure of the Building and pulled existing Cat5 (sadly, no Cat5e) cables down from the 2nd floor to our rooms in the 1st floor.
Now that the server room now is nearly ready for the racks we will start to bring in 2 40RU racks for the servers and 1 smaller rack for the network infrastructure.
Thanks to all the helpers who made it possible to get so far within a few days.</p>
