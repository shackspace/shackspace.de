<p>shackspace resident hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/4rm4">Robert</a> is at it again. This time around he&#39;s built a new frame for this quad-copter.
In the past he&#39;s used everything from aluminium, carbon fiber to 3D-printed parts to build his copters and had mixed results (one 3D-printed copter<a href="http://armageddon421.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AyvFn1YCQAEyvgq.jpg"> melted in the summer heat</a> while stored in his car).</p>
<p>Now he went with an <a href="http://armageddon421.de/?p=319">all-new plywood design</a>. The whole thing only weighs in at 167 gramms and - despite being assembled without a single drop of glue - is very sturdy.</p>
