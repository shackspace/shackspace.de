Last weekend, @[layer1gfx](https://twitter.com/layer1gfx) held a Graffiti workshop at shackspace, with  our own @[hdznrrd](https://twitter.com/hdznrrd), @[momorientes](https://twitter.com/momorientes) and @[samuirai](https://twitter.com/samuirai) participating among others.  The merry group of four aimed high when they planned a picture covering  the whole back wall of our stair head.Â  While not participating himself, @[dop3j0e](https://twitter.com/dop3j0e) documented the whole process,  from white wall to final picture, using @[h0uz3](https://twitter.com/h0uz3)'s Canon EOS 5D and an  impromptu infrared intervalometer cobbled together from some parts we  had lying around.
At one picture every five seconds, the whole process took some 7.500  photos, condensed to five minutes of timelapse for your viewing  pleasure. So sit back and watch a wall being transformed into art!
