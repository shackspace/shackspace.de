<p>The last weekend was full of hard work, but it paid out, and now we can proudly announce that the roomforming is completed.
Many walls had to fall and it took us a lot of time to discover all the screws that the builders of the walls had hidden, but we made it and shackspace 2.0 is now looking as shown on this sketch (click to enlarge).

<p>The last walls to fall weren&#39;t needed for any other purpose so <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=1865">three hackers killed them the hacker way</a> ;)</p>
