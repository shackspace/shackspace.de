Of the 161 People’s Choice nominations of NASA's Space Apps Challenge this year, our Stuttgart's cress.space project rose to the top. The NASA jury loved your "**_creative interpretation of the challenge_**" and informed us about their nomintation.

_**Congratulations Team cress.space!!!!**_

The [cress.space](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/mars/simspace/projects/cress.space) team worked hard during the 48h hackathon to create autonomous farming, through machine learning on basis on collaborative gaming for off-earth as well as on-earth applications.
For achieving this, they set-up a demonstrator green-house that will be used as the baseline farming hardware for our game.

The team that makes it to the end will receive invitations to attend a launch, most likely in September at the Kennedy Space Center.
