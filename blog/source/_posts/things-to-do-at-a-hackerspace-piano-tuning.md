As some of you might know already, shackspace does have a piano for everyone to play.
Of course we also have quite a few members who can use this instrument virtuously and do so on a regular basis.
However, our piano was suffering from a few notes which were slightly out of tune.

Lucky for us we also have members who have both the equipment and skill to do day to day tuning jobs. Now, without further ado, we shall present you shackspace resident musician and piano virtuoso [flyx](http://flyx.org/) tuning the shackspace piano. The suspense! It's unbearable!
