As [previously mentioned](/?p=1943), we've had a nice long Easter weekend with lots of cooking going on at shackspace.

After a really nice BBQ session on Friday, Saturday started off with a shopping spree.Â  A rough total of 280 EUR was spent on food alone which turned out to be a worthwhile investment :)
