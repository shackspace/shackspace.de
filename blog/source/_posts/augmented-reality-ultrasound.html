After the initial awesomeness subsided the machine started collecting dust in a corner.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vskobov">Victor</a> visited us and asked if he could borrow the machine for a project idea he had. We decided to go one step further and made the machine a present to him.</p>
<p>Now Victor reported back in. The machine is working and he managed to implement his idea: <strong>augmented reality ultrasound</strong>!</p>
