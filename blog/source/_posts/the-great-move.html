<p>It&#39;s time, we have to move!</p>
<p>On March 31st Deutsche Bahn (owner of the property) will close down the whole area around the old shackspace location at Stuttgart&#39;s Nordbahnhof.  Everything still left in the location after that date is lost.
shackspace is on the move this weekend!</p>
<p>We&#39;ve already rented a big truck and are ready to get everything done Friday/Saturday/Sunday this week (we kind of have to).
If you want to drop by and help out, come join us <strong>Saturday morning 10am</strong> sharp and <strong>Sunday 11am</strong> sharp at the old shackspace location (Ã„usserer Nordbahnhof 12).</p>
<p>If you want to join us, please let us know!  We&#39;ve got a <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=umzug:todo-kw12">wiki page set up</a> where we&#39;ll be organizing this weeks workload.  We&#39;ve also got a <a href="https://lists.shackspace.de/mailman/listinfo/umzug">mailing list just for the move</a>.</p>
