[![](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cleaningrage.png "cleaningrage")](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cleaningrage.png)We'll be meeting on a regular basis at the space to clean up!
Nobody likes to work or hang out in a messy environment and lots of people produce lots of ... well, leftovers :)

Here's what we do:

*   Meet for an hour of cleaning-rage
*   Everyone gets a more or less randomly selected task assigned (there's single-person tasks and multiple-person tasks)
*   Do it
*   Feel good about it
The key thing here is: cleaning doesn't have to be a big ugly mess if you do it often enough and if you don't have to do the same thing every time.

Check out the [cleaning rage wiki page](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:cleaningrage) for more details.

Be awesome!
