We've had a very busy and successful weekend (and week) and just to let you know about all the things that did happen, here's a small re-cap.

From Friday evening to Sunday evening we've had a lot of visitors from [JuFORUM e.V.](http://www.juforum.de/), the German junior scientist network.  They've been holding their yearly IT weekend, getting their infrastructure organized and up to date.

shackspace participated successfully in the Hobby &amp; Elektronik fair  where we've given soldering workshops, talks and presented the space and its  projects.

There's now a [trinocular (stereo + camera) microscope](http://yfrog.com/nzdjuedj) for your SMD soldering endeavors, complete with 1.3MPix USB camera.  The analog camera and monitor that originally came with the package were instantly re-tasked as a teaching aid for workshops that do not require a microscope.

The [Constellation / Hackerspace Global Grid](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:hgg) project did a big leap towards the intermediate goal of getting a stable and accurate time-source for the distributed satellite groundstation network up and running.  The proof of concept based on [EM-406 GPS modules, Arduino Mega 2560 and the Adafruit GPS Logger Shield](http://yfrog.com/oe3i7hej) will be further refined in the following days.

There's new pets in town! @[rel0c8](https://twitter.com/rel0c8) is trying to breed some [artemia salina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemia_salina).  For science!  (And that bitter sweet memory of [Yps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yps_%28comics%29)).

There's an increasing amount of UV fluorescent coloring on our data center floor.  You should really check it out ;)

And magic made it all complete when we've watched the new episode of [MLP:FiM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_is_Magic) Saturday night :D
