<p><a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=4343">Quite some time</a> ago we&#39;ve teamed up with our friends at <a href="http://www.pcb-pool.com/">PCB-pool</a> to send Dave something we thought he&#39;d really appreciate. Turns out he did, but it also blew up (in parts).
However, there&#39;s news! He just got around using the Back-to-the-Future Clock as an example for how to do SMD reworking.</p>
