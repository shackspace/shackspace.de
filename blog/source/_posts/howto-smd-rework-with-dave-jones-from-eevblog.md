[Quite some time](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=4343) ago we've teamed up with our friends at [PCB-pool](http://www.pcb-pool.com/) to send Dave something we thought he'd really appreciate. Turns out he did, but it also blew up (in parts).
However, there's news! He just got around using the Back-to-the-Future Clock as an example for how to do SMD reworking.

Enjoy the video:
