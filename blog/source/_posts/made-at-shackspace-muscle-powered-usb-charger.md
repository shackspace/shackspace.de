Sometimes they're just a bit silly bordering on trolling.

Definitely to be found in the latter category is [hadez](https://twitter.com/hdznrrd)' [muscle-powered USB charger](http://log.follvalsch.de/post/88566572556/muscle-powered-usb-charger-at-shackspace-we-had). This bastard child of an old sewing machine table sans theÂ manual sewing machine, a bike dynamo and a bunch of electronic components is more of a workout machine than a charger.

However, feel free to try it yourself when you visit the space ;)
