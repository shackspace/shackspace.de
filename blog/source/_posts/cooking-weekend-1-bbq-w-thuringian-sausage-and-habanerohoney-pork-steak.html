<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/SaijSaij">SaijSaij</a> provided us with the most awesome and authentic <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Thuringian_sausage">Thuringian sausages</a>.  Being a native Thuringian himself he of course brought the real product after returning from a trip back home.  Just plain delicious!  If you&#39;ve never tasted the real thing, you&#39;re definitely missing out.  By the way, for that little extra, drip some <a href="http://www.koestritzer.de/">Koestritzer</a> over the sausages while they&#39;re on the grill and make sure the coals are no longer burning and not too hot.</p>
<p>On top of that there was pork fillet marinated in @<a href="https://twitter.com/hdznrrd">hdznrrd</a>&#39;s <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=rezept:mariande:sweet_spicy_habanero">honey/habanero marinade</a>.</p>
