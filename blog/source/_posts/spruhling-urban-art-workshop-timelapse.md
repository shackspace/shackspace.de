Back in March this year [layer1gfx](http://layer1gfx.carbonmade.com/) did his second [Urban Art Workshop](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=2890) which was totally fracking rad to say the least.   This time, over the the course of one weekend five folks, three synchronized cameras and hundreds of euros invested in a full rainbow spectrum of colors (including UV effect colors) resulted in major upgrades to the shackspace staircase.

We now have: A big "Weltraum" style, a Bender spraycan, a UFO, an Angry Bird, Tacgnol &amp; Longcat, Krebs, Zoidberg, and Twilight Sparkle in space!

Here's the making off:
