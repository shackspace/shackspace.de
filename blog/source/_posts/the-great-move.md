It's time, we have to move!

On March 31st Deutsche Bahn (owner of the property) will close down the whole area around the old shackspace location at Stuttgart's Nordbahnhof.  Everything still left in the location after that date is lost.
shackspace is on the move this weekend!

We've already rented a big truck and are ready to get everything done Friday/Saturday/Sunday this week (we kind of have to).
If you want to drop by and help out, come join us **Saturday morning 10am** sharp and **Sunday 11am** sharp at the old shackspace location (Äusserer Nordbahnhof 12).

If you want to join us, please let us know!  We've got a [wiki page set up](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=umzug:todo-kw12) where we'll be organizing this weeks workload.  We've also got a [mailing list just for the move](https://lists.shackspace.de/mailman/listinfo/umzug).
