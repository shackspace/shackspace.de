Yesterday we were very lucky as @<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dop3j0e">dop3j0e </a>walked in with a huge <a href="http://www.helmut-singer.de/stock/1073804467.html">Hewlett Packard 54111D Digitizing Oscilloscope</a> including 2x 3GHz probes. It  is fully programmable with HP-IB !</p>
<p>We also recieved a <a href="http://www.globaltestsupply.com/c/1/6624A_Power_Supply_40W_HP_Agilent.html">HP 6624A System DC power supply</a>. The power supply has some nice features such as programmability which allows a voltage accuracy of up to 50mV. It is delivering 0-7V with 0-5A, 0-20V with 0-2A and 0-50V with 0-0.8A.</p>
<p>We would like to thank @<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dop3j0e">dop3j0e</a> for his efforts and IBM for the kind donation.</p>
