<p>Of the 161 People’s Choice nominations of NASA&#39;s Space Apps Challenge this year, our Stuttgart&#39;s cress.space project rose to the top. The NASA jury loved your &quot;<strong><em>creative interpretation of the challenge</em></strong>&quot; and informed us about their nomintation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Congratulations Team cress.space!!!!</strong></em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/mars/simspace/projects/cress.space">cress.space</a> team worked hard during the 48h hackathon to create autonomous farming, through machine learning on basis on collaborative gaming for off-earth as well as on-earth applications.
For achieving this, they set-up a demonstrator green-house that will be used as the baseline farming hardware for our game.</p>
