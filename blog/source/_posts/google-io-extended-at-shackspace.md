Quoting the [official announcement](http://blackforest.gtugs.org/home/google-i-o-extended):

[![](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/stuttgartgtuglogo-300x168.png "stuttgartgtuglogo")](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/stuttgartgtuglogo.png)As tickets to Google I/O were sold out within ~50 minutes,   worldwide "Google I/O Extended Events" (mostly organized by GTUGs) will   make it possible to watch the keynotes live on a stable stream with   other interested developers, fans and friends.
The Stuttgart GTUG and the Black Forest GTUG join in together to bring Google I/O to Stuttgart!
There will be food &amp; drinks - and Swag - for all participants and a (hopefully) stable livestream.
