@[SaijSaij](https://twitter.com/SaijSaij) provided us with the most awesome and authentic [Thuringian sausages](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Thuringian_sausage).  Being a native Thuringian himself he of course brought the real product after returning from a trip back home.  Just plain delicious!  If you've never tasted the real thing, you're definitely missing out.  By the way, for that little extra, drip some [Koestritzer](http://www.koestritzer.de/) over the sausages while they're on the grill and make sure the coals are no longer burning and not too hot.

On top of that there was pork fillet marinated in @[hdznrrd](https://twitter.com/hdznrrd)'s [honey/habanero marinade](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=rezept:mariande:sweet_spicy_habanero).
