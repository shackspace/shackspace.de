<p>We&#39;ve had a very busy and successful weekend (and week) and just to let you know about all the things that did happen, here&#39;s a small re-cap.</p>
<p>From Friday evening to Sunday evening we&#39;ve had a lot of visitors from <a href="http://www.juforum.de/">JuFORUM e.V.</a>, the German junior scientist network.  They&#39;ve been holding their yearly IT weekend, getting their infrastructure organized and up to date.</p>
<p>shackspace participated successfully in the Hobby &amp; Elektronik fair  where we&#39;ve given soldering workshops, talks and presented the space and its  projects.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now a <a href="http://yfrog.com/nzdjuedj">trinocular (stereo + camera) microscope</a> for your SMD soldering endeavors, complete with 1.3MPix USB camera.  The analog camera and monitor that originally came with the package were instantly re-tasked as a teaching aid for workshops that do not require a microscope.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:hgg">Constellation / Hackerspace Global Grid</a> project did a big leap towards the intermediate goal of getting a stable and accurate time-source for the distributed satellite groundstation network up and running.  The proof of concept based on <a href="http://yfrog.com/oe3i7hej">EM-406 GPS modules, Arduino Mega 2560 and the Adafruit GPS Logger Shield</a> will be further refined in the following days.</p>
<p>There&#39;s new pets in town! @<a href="https://twitter.com/rel0c8">rel0c8</a> is trying to breed some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemia_salina">artemia salina</a>.  For science!  (And that bitter sweet memory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yps_%28comics%29">Yps</a>).</p>
<p>There&#39;s an increasing amount of UV fluorescent coloring on our data center floor.  You should really check it out ;)</p>
<p>And magic made it all complete when we&#39;ve watched the new episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_is_Magic">MLP:FiM</a> Saturday night :D</p>
