By now it's one of the shackspace traditions to have a DJ around at a party.  Lucky for us we've got a couple of DJs amongst us!
The last two events of this sort happened a week ago when one of our own, momo, turned 18 and again this Saturday when we had our yearly "open door" event.

momo's birthday was powered by DJs [Saiba](https://twitter.com/layer1gfx) and [Jocki](https://twitter.com/dop3j0e) bringing you the finest mix of Drum &amp; Bass, Blips &amp; Breaks, Dubstep, and Trance.  Definitely something to take to the floor!

Saturday's "open door" set a slightly different mood.  Learning from past events a loud party wasn't going to work out in this context.  So the lounge was decorated to be exactly that: a lounge.
Grab a cocktail, hang out on the comfy couches, chat, hack, socialize.  All the while with DJ [philgrooves](https://twitter.com/philgrooves) spinning Deep House and Techno then handing off to [Jocki](https://twitter.com/dop3j0e) who played some very chilled-out Drum &amp; Bass vibes.  The evening culminated in a Phil vs. Jocki back-to-back House ping-pong duel.
