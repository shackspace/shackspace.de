Thanks to [Sabrina Winter](http://vimeo.com/user972774) who was very busy filming and interviewing the participants of [this year's Global Game Jam](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=3707) at [shackspace](https://blog.shackspace.de/) there's now a video documentation showcasing some of the games and folks behind them.

After watching the video make sure to [check out the flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/regionstuttgart/sets/72157632636985537/with/8428867933/) and [play the games](http://globalgamejam.org/sites/2013/global-game-jam-stuttgart/games) as well!
