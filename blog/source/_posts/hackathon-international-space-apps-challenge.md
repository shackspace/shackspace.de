[![](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/brandingguidelines.jpg "Space Apps Challenge")](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/brandingguidelines.jpg)The [International Space Apps Challenge](http://spaceappschallenge.org/) is your opportunity to build, create, and invent new solutions to challenges of global importance and shackspace is happy to announce that you can join this effort [right here in Stuttgart](http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/shackspace), Germany.  shackspace teamed up with AerospaceResearch.net to host a [weekend long hackathon](https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:spaceappschallenge2012) (shackspace wiki).

Among the many and still [growing numbers of challenges](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/) there's also a few thought up by our fellow colleagues of AerospaceResearch.net.  [Brightest Night](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/brightest-night/)'s aim is to build a network of webcams to measure the ever increasing amount of light pollution introduced by growing urban areas and the spread of civilization into the furthers reaches of formerly untouched nature.  A fundamentally different question is posed by [Tour of the Solar System](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/tour-solar-system/) which tries to determine if and how it would be possible to visit all the planets of our solar system with a simple Voyager class probe.
You're free to post your own ideas or pick any idea you want and work on it.
