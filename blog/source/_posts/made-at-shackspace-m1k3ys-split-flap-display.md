If you've been to shackspace in the last week or two you might have come across [M1k3y's split-flap display](http://m1k3y.de/0002-split-flap-display-de.html).

It's not yet 100% finished, but already an essential part of the shackspace lounge. So far he got most of the modules working and is still fighting with some of them dying for an as of yet undetermined reason.

However, if you happen to be at shackspace, check out the display and use it!
As with so many cool projects, this too has a web interface. It allows you to either send chunks of text in one go or trigger each position individually. Already there are other projects at the space which use the display as an output device and there's bound to be more of them in the foreseeable future.
