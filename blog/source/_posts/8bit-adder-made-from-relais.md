shack member _Mr. Pi_ built this magnificently scary contraption of industrial misappropriation.

What used to be the pump controller of a high-rise building's heating system, is now an [8bit adder](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Adder_%28electronics%29). It comes with registers for input, storage and output; all conveniently controlled via circuit breaker switches. Since this is industrial grade hardware it's of course powered by 230V mains fed into the setup from a wall socket via two banana jacks (note: we do have a mains circuit with special safety features for fun like that at shackspace).
