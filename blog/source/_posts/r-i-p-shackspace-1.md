As you [might have noticed](http://rescue.shackspace.de/) almost one and a half years ago, we had to leave our first location due to a large and infamous construction project going on here in Stuttgart.  As you hopefully also noticed, we're doing better than ever having found an awesome and quite large location in March 2011.

Now these past days we got a sad reminder of the past and what was told to happen finally happened.  The old location where shackspace spent its first year was torn down.  With the building we've also lost our [beloved mascot Bastelbert](https://blog.shackspace.de/?p=1428) which was sprayed onto the front wall of the building.  Now all that's left is a heap of rubble and many good memories.  Time to move on!
