[![videograbber_on_raspi](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/videograbber_on_raspi-300x268.jpg)](https://blog.shackspace.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/videograbber_on_raspi.jpg)shackspace hacker makefu is at it again. This time he's hacked together a video grabber, a microcontroller running a keyboard emulation, and a few adapters.

What's that good for, you ask? He now has a low-cost solution to access the video output of a wide range of small embedded devices and control them via (emulated) keyboard. This should come in quite handy the next time your Raspberry Pi or similar is stuck and need to debug it.
