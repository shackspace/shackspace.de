The only slight downside is that the laser can (at the moment) only be controlled through a quirky Windows software - the reverse engineering job is still pending. Also there&#39;s a lot of people around which just <em>had</em> to buy &quot;a few&quot; Raspberry Pies when it came out as new - ultra-affordable mini-PC last year.</p>
<p>While looking for use cases for the new toy we discovered that it makes an awesome  (literally) thin client. It has a very low power consumption ~2W and manages to handle remote desktop applications reasonably fast.</p>
<p>To combine both pain (Windows Krepelsoftware) and pleasure (RasPI) the motivation for this project is to provide a means to control the laser cutter - and since the software for controlling it only runs on Windows - without requiring a native Windows computer (which concerns most people around here).</p>

Next we had to find a way to boot directly to that machine which lead us to using xtightvncviewer - which gives the impression of running Windows 7 natively (fullscreen with the resolution of the TFT Screen). <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=berries#thin_client">For setup instructions please check the shackspace wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Now we were faced with the challenge to forward the USB port of the Raspberry Pi - to which we were planning to connect the laser cutter to - to our virtual Windows machine. This creates the &#39;physical link from the laser cutter to the virtual host.</p>
<p>The solution we stumbled across was the <a href="http://usbip.sourceforge.net/">USBIP project</a>.
Since the USBIP modules are only in available in staging we needed to build a whole new Linux kernel for the Raspberry Pi as the module is not natively included into the current baseline kernel. It took about two days to make it work - mainly because we didn&#39;t have much experience building kernels beforehand. You can find <a href="https://blog.shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=berries#usbip">detailed instructions on USBIP on the shackspace wiki</a>. The result is a clean Raspberry Pi image with the loadable USBIP module included.  We started out building only the required modules and such mischiefs - instructions for building a kernel that lets you actually load the modules you built (as usip-host in our case) will follow shortly.</p>
<p>In addition to that there is at the moment a mismatch of the USB packet headers sent between the USBIP Linux server and Windows client. This caused far more head-ache than expected - partly because of our combined lack of knowledge of the Windows platform. Fortunately our Google-Fu was strong and we were able to find  a  Windows client which is working with the current USBIP release somewhere on the internet.</p>
<p>After quite a few non-booting Linux images, tons of blue screens and kernel panics the results were satisfying and we remotely lazored the no-fucking sign:</p>

<p>We were asked to make some pictures or a video - and since we don&#39;t take ourselves too serious - we came up with the idea of doing it with one of the mascots hanging out in our hackerspace (next up shaqueline?!).</p>
<p>So here we go: Pedro the bear explains how he got Windows 7 running on an Raspberry Pi to control the 50W Lazor of shackspace:</p>
