Yesterday we were very lucky as @[dop3j0e ](https://twitter.com/#!/dop3j0e)walked in with a huge [Hewlett Packard 54111D Digitizing Oscilloscope](http://www.helmut-singer.de/stock/1073804467.html) including 2x 3GHz probes. It  is fully programmable with HP-IB !

We also recieved a [HP 6624A System DC power supply](http://www.globaltestsupply.com/c/1/6624A_Power_Supply_40W_HP_Agilent.html). The power supply has some nice features such as programmability which allows a voltage accuracy of up to 50mV. It is delivering 0-7V with 0-5A, 0-20V with 0-2A and 0-50V with 0-0.8A.

We would like to thank @[dop3j0e](https://twitter.com/#!/dop3j0e) for his efforts and IBM for the kind donation.
